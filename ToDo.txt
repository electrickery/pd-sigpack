Sigpack 0.0.4+ ToDo

- check the objects ported from swh-plugins with latest version from 
  www.plugins.org.uk or 
  http://http.debian.net/debian/pool/main/s/swh-plugins/swh-plugins_0.4.15+1.orig.tar.gz
- move all sample rate settings to dsp method
- sieve~: find out how it should work and implement it. Don't forget to optimize.
- split~: add a mode for hold, next to the current switch to 0.
- transient~: find out why it doesn't work and fix it. Replacing guts with 
  newer original code doesn't work.
