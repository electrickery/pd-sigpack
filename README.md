sigpack - signal object library for pure-data (c) 2006 by Martin Wei√ü

This git-fork of the Pure-data library maxlib is cloned from https://git.puredata.info/cgit/svn2git/libraries/sigpack.git, which is the svn-to-git from https://sourceforge.net/p/pure-data/svn/HEAD/tree/trunk/externals/sigpack/.

The initial changes were adding/recreating some separate directories for source and help files and replace the buildsystem by pd-lib-builder. This to simplify creation of a deken package of the libary.

A subset of the objects is derived from the swh_plugins written by Steve Harris (http://www.plugin.org.uk):
diode~     (diode_1185)
foldover~  (foldover_1213)
freqdiv~   (divider_1186)
freqshift~ (bode-shifter_1431)
hardlimit~ (hard_limiter_1413)
harmgen~   (harmonic_gen_1220)
impulse~   (impulse_1885)
shape~     (shaper_1187)
transient~ (transient_1206)
valverect~ (valve_rect_1405)
wavewrap~  (sinus_wavewrapper_1198)

See the original README.txt for more information.
